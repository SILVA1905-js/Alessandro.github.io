# Tic Tac Toe (#)

A code that simulates a game known as Tic Tac Toe.

## Description

This is a code made with JavaScript (JS) and other technologies... In this code, I wanted to create a playable version of the tic-tac-toe game, and after a lot of research, I was able to create something close to my objective. I used functions such as: Square, Button, Div, Class, jQuery... Not to mention the CSS styling, which was essential for the game's aesthetics. Currently, when the last move is made, it is not displayed on the grid, which is something that I wish to change.

## How to use

The project can be used for personal fun or between friends... the game works as follows: it's a simple and classic game played on a 3x3 board, usually between two players. Each player marks their move with an "X" or an "O" in one of the nine cells of the board, with the objective of forming a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three identical symbols before the opponent.

The game starts with an empty board and the player who plays with "X" makes the first move. Then, the players alternate moves until one player wins or all cells are filled, resulting in a tie. A player wins when they manage to form a line with their symbols before the opponent.

I am grateful especially for my willpower, and also to the teacher Pedro Holuboski. I believe that without this, this project would not be possible.
